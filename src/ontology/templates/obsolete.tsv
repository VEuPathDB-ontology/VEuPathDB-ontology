"The original trap CDC gravid trap (or gravid trap of Reiter) consists of a 3 inch diameter PVC inlet tube housing a 6 V motor, as used in CDC traps, on which is mounted a four-bladed 3 inch counter-clockwise fan. The inlet tube is clamped between two vertical wooden boards that fit over a black plastic box (18.5 x 14.0 x 6.5 inches). A plastic 12 inch long PVC chimney slots into the upper end of the inlet tube. The top half consists of three struts that fit into and support a netting collecting bag. For this the middle of the collecting bag is reinforced with a circular patch of denim cloth. The oviposition attractant is made by adding 1 lb of hay and 1 oz each of dried brewer's yeast and lactalbumen powder to 30 gallons of tap water. This infusion is allowed to mature for 5 days. This original gravid mosquito trap of Reiter suffers from certain limitations, namely up to 10% of the catch of adults is damaged by passing through the fan blades, and adults tend to die of desiccation.
