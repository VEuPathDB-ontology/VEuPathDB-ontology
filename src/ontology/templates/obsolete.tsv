The inlet tube is clamped between two vertical wooden boards that fit over a black plastic box (18.5 x 14.0 x 6.5 inches). A plastic 12 inch long PVC chimney slots into the upper end of the inlet tube. The top half consists of three struts that fit into and support a netting collecting bag. For this the middle of the collecting bag is reinforced with a circular patch of denim cloth. The oviposition attractant is made by adding 1 lb of hay and 1 oz each of dried brewer's yeast and lactalbumen powder to 30 gallons of tap water. This infusion is allowed to mature for 5 days. This original gravid mosquito trap of Reiter suffers from certain limitations, namely up to 10% of the catch of adults is damaged by passing through the fan blades, and adults tend to die of desiccation.

EUPATH:0043054	class	obsolete free-standing window trap		"An arthropod trap that consists of a transparent window placed in a box that holds a liquid solution deadly to arthropods. This trap is designed to stop an arthropod in flight, causing it to fall into the liquid and die."	VSMO:0001649					Obsolete Class	true	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000228	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0003046	"For example, Jonsson developed a free-standing window trap consisting of a 16 x 20-cm perspex box, 16 cm high and divided in the middle by a 20 x 36-cm sheet of perspex (window).  The two compartments of the box are filled to a depth of about 12 cm with 4-6% formalin containing a few drops of detergent; in winter ethylene glycol can be added to prevent freezing.  One or two holes drilled in one side of the box at 12 cm and covered with fine netting prevent the trap overflowing after heavy rain.  Traps are mounted on aluminium poles.  Flying insects on hitting the transparent vertical plastic window fall into the formalin.  The window trap may catch vectors that are seeking a host or moving for other purposes.""
