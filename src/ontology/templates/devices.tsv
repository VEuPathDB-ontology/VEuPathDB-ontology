EUPATH:0043050	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gravid trap				"An arthropod trap that consists of a transparent window placed in a box that holds a liquid solution deadly to arthropods. This trap is designed to stop an arthropod in flight, causing it to fall into the liquid and die."	VSMO:0001649	"Jonsson developed a free-standing window trap consisting of a 16 x 20-cm perspex box, 16 cm high and divided in the middle by a 20 x 36-cm sheet of perspex (window).  The two compartments of the box are filled to a depth of about 12 cm with 4-6% formalin containing a few drops of detergent; in winter ethylene glycol can be added to prevent freezing.  One or two holes drilled in one side of the box at 12 cm and covered with fine netting prevent the trap overflowing after heavy rain.  Traps are mounted on aluminium poles.  Flying insects on hitting the transparent vertical plastic window fall into the formalin.  The window trap may catch vectors that are seeking a host or moving for other purposes.""
